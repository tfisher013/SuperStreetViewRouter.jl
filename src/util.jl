    check_solution_feasibility(soln::Solution, city_meta_graph::CityGraph; verbose=false)::Bool


Check if `soln` satisfies the constraints for the instance defined by `city_meta_graph`.
    The following criteria are considered (taken from the problem statement):
    - the number of itineraries has to match the number of cars of `city_meta_graph`
    - the first junction of each itinerary has to be the starting junction of `city_meta_graph`
    - for each consecutive pair of junctions on an itinerary, a street connecting these junctions has to exist in `city_meta_graph` (if the street is one directional, it has to be traversed in the correct direction)
    - the duration of each itinerary has to be lower or equal to the total duration of `city_meta_graph`
